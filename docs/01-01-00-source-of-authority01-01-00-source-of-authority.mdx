# 01.01.00 - Source of Authority

The Board of County Supervisors further established, within the Prince William County Department of Parks & Recreation, the Office of Tourism via a resolution passed on August 1, 2017, under authority granted through Section 15.2-518 of the Code of Virginia. This action ended the Board’s delegation of tourism promotion functions to the Prince William and Manassas Convention and Visitors Bureau effective September 1, 2017. Staff and functions related to tourism promotion were merged into the Department on October 1, 2017. On September 11, 2018 the Department of Parks and Recreation was renamed the Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism (DPRT) by the BOCS.

DPRT was preceded by Prince William County Park Authority. The Park Authority was incorporated on October 11, 1977 by the BOCS. The Authority held responsibility for parks and recreation areas and service within the County through its dissolution on June 30, 2012.

The Prince William County Department of Parks and Recreation was established as a Department within the Government of Prince William County on July 1, 2012 through Prince William Board of County Supervisors Resolution Number 12-326. The Prince William Board of County Supervisors (BOCS) is provided the authority to establish parks and recreation facilities, collect fees from the use of such assets, collect and appropriate property tax dollars for their maintenance, and to manage and operate them through a County Department (or other body to whom the County delegates authority) through Section 15.2-1806 of the Code of Virginia.
